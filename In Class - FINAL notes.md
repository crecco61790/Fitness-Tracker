# Fitness-Tracker typeahead

Share component on my tracker utilizes a "_Share Service"

HTTP.Get call returns entry(includes user ID) array of work outs posted to shared log
	service function call then parses through entries and returns unique
	array of fitness tracker users

currently only users who have already posted a shared array will returned on typeahead

Display is kind of funny, doesn't display only matching users... working on that.

Display has been fixed!
